# What is this
I started this project to familiarize myself with the application of machine learning techniques after I realized that, while I knew the concepts, I had no idea how to apply them concretely and no practical experience in the field.

The goal here is to implement many different machine learning methods from scratch to get a better understanding of all the moving parts. Performance is not a concern as long as it works.
